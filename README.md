# Patterns of language switching and bilingual childrens word learning: An experiment across two communities
## Project overview
Bilingual Families Project's online study: Word learning task. 
*  In this task we are investigating 3- to 5-year-old bilingual children's learning of cross-language synonyms (i.e., translation equivalents) in immediate translated sentences versus single language sentences.
*  Bilingual children's word learning will be assessed with an online asynchronous experiment. The design uses repeated measures, with condition (*Immediate-translation* condition vs. *One-language-at-a-time* condition) as within-subjects factor. Children will be taught and tested on four novel word-object pairings; half of the pairings will occur in immediate translated sentences (i.e., *Immediate-translation* condition) and half will occur in single language sentences (i.e., *One-language-at-a-time* condition). The experiment will be divided in two blocks, blocked by condition with the block order counterbalanced across participants.

## Repository overview
This repository holds the experiment materials, data file, data analysis scripts, and supplemental materials for the project "Patterns of language switching and bilingual children's word learning: An experiment across two communities" (https://psyarxiv.com/hpwbr).

Current files include:

* `Analysis`: Data file and R markdown analysis scripts 
* `Experiment_demo`: Video demonstrations of the experiment, along with the jsPsych script to create the experiment demo program
* `Experiment_program`: Repository for the four different test orders (4 orders per site, so there are 8 versions in total)
* `Praat_script`: Praat scripts used to generate the audio stimuli for the experiment
* `Stimuli_audio`: Audio stimuli used
* `Stimuli_image`: Visual stimuli used
